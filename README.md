# epi-reanalysis

by Tamas Nagy & Nat Hendel

For our final project in BMI 206 we are reanalyzing data from the
following paper:

> Ziller, M.J., Edri, R., Yaffe, Y., Donaghey, J., Pop, R., Mallard, W.,
Issner, R., Gifford, C.A., Goren, A., Xing, J., et al. (2015). Dissecting
neural differentiation regulatory networks through epigenetic
footprinting. Nature 518, 355â€“359.

## Goals

The project's goals are as follows:

1. *Reanalysis:* Evaluate your own understanding and the reliability of the
   published results by attempting to make a figure, table or other main
   result on your own from their data. Do you come to the same conclusions
   when you analyze their data with similar methods?

2. *Sensitivity:* Explore the sensitivity of at least one main finding to
   the methods employed. Do you come to the same conclusions when you
   analyze their data with a different method, different parameters, or
   different software settings?

3. *New Analysis:* Address at least one novel question not covered by the
   authors using their data.
